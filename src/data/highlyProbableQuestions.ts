          "Differentiate between biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste with two examples of each. Why is non-biodegradable waste a cause of concern?",
        answer:
          "Biodegradable: decomposed by microorganisms (e.g. vegetable peels, paper). Non-biodegradable: not easily decomposed (e.g. plastics, metals). Non-biodegradable waste accumulates, pollutes soil and water and enters food chains.",
