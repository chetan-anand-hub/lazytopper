// src/utils/getTopicV2Content.ts
//
// Helper for resolving TopicHub v2 content.  This simplified helper
// attempts to retrieve a rich content record from the v2 dataset.  If
// no record is found for a given topic, it builds a minimal object
// containing basic information such as the subject, topic key, topic
// display name and some placeholder sections.  The goal is to ensure
// TopicHub always has something to render for any topic, even if
// that topic has not yet been fully migrated to the v2 schema.

import { topicHubV2Content } from '../data/topicHubV2Full';
import { resolveTopicKey, resolveTopicDisplayName } from './topicResolver';

// Define the shape of each content record.  This mirrors the
// TopicHub v2 specification used in the migration plan.  Fields may
// be empty arrays when content is unavailable.
